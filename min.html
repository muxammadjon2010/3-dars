        have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up
        understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry
        and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from
        whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct
        my dedication:</p>

        <p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about
            the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a
            copy of the drawing.

    <div class="cvb"><i>
            <br>In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are
            not
            able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."
            <br> <br>
            I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I
            succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:</i><br>

        <br>

    <img src="./klobouk.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="blo">
        <p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.</p>
        <i>But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</i>
        <p4>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But
            since
            the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa
            constrictor, so <br> </p4><br>
    </div>
    <img src="./slon.jpg" alt="">
    <div class="buk">
        <p3>
            The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether
            from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar.
            That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been
            disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Numbe r One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand
            anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to <br>
        </p3>
        <br>
        <p3>So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of
            the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China
            from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is <br></p3>

        <p3> <br>In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been
            concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them
            intimately, close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them. <br> </p3>

        <p3><br>Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him
            my
            Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true
            understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: <br></p3>

    </div>
    <div class="nml">
        <br><i>"That is a hat."</i><br>

        <p3><br>Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would
            bring
            myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the
            grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.</p3>

    <div class="olma">
        <h1>II</h1>

    <div class="nhj">
        <p3>So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane
            in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a
            mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of
            life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week. <br></p3><br>


        <p3> The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more
            isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement,
            at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said: <br></p3><br>

        <i>"If you please--draw me a sheep!" <br></i><br>
        <i>"What!"<br></i><br>
        <i>"Draw me a sheep!"<br></i><br>
        <p4>I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And
            I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may
            see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less
            <br> </p4><br>
        <br> <img src="./malyPrinc.jpg" alt=""><br>
        <p4>That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years
            old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.</p4>
